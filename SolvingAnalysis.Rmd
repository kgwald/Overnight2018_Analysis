###Notes to self:
#1) Add data cleaning script first (need to correct for puzzle that was solved in the evening after moving on to the next puzzle)


#2) Need to format tables better... something to do with the kable function in knitr?
    #After much struggle (kable was producing a blank screen) I got the kable() function to work by:
    #1. installing the latest version of RStudio and 2. making sure I was using dplyr::summarize function
    #Also adding the kableExtra package gives additional simple formatting options

#3) There is apparently a way to cache things so that knitting doesn't take as long (reading in the data every time is a hassle)
    #seems like I just need to add the option "cache = TRUE" to a code chunk and it will cache instead of     #re-loading each time -- will need to be careful if it does change though and needs to be reloaded

# Solving Analysis for Evening and Morning Data


```{r preprocessing, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
source("Overnight2018ReadPresentationData.R")
d <- Overnight2018ReadPresentationData()

EData <- d[[4]]
MData <- d[[5]]

EData <- EData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

MData <- MData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

## Solution Rates by Subject

### Evening

```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
e_propsolv <- EData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Solved = mean(Solved))

showNiceTable(e_propsolv, "Evening Solving Rates")

```

### Morning

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#Overall
m_propsolv <- MData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Solved = mean(Solved))

m_propsolv <- createAverageRow(m_propsolv) #add average row

#By Cued Status
m_propsolv_CU <- MData %>%
  dplyr::group_by(SID,CuedStatus) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(ProportionSolved = mean(Solved)) %>%
  spread(CuedStatus, ProportionSolved) %>%

m_propsolv_CU <- createAverageRow(m_propsolv_CU) #add average row

showNiceTable(m_propsolv_CU, "Morning Solving Rates by Cueing")

```


## Memory Rates by Subject

### Evening

##### Evening Overall

```{r}

source("Overnight2018CleanEveningMemory.R")

eMem <- Overnight2018CleanEveningMemory()

#Memory for Each Round and Overall
e_psmem <- eMem %>%
  group_by(SID,Round) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Recalled = mean(PSRecallAcc)) %>%
  spread(Round, Proportion_Recalled) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Average = rowMeans(.[,2:5])) #gets the row mean

e_psmem <- createRowAverage(e_psmem)

showNiceTable(e_psmem, "Evening Puzzle-Sound Memory by Round")

```

##### Evening by Session

```{r}
#Memory for Eacch Round by Session

e_psmem_bysess <- eMem %>%
  group_by(SID,Session,Round) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Recalled = mean(PSRecallAcc))


#Graph

e_psmem_bysess$SID <- as.factor(e_psmem_bysess$SID)
e_psmem_bysess$Session <- as.factor(e_psmem_bysess$Session)
e_psmem_bysess$Round <- as.factor(e_psmem_bysess$Round)

  theme_bw() +
  geom_point(aes(color = SID)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = SID)) +
  facet_grid(.~ Session)

#Overall Averages
e_psmem_bysess2 <- e_psmem_bysess %>%
