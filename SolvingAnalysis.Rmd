```{r}
###Notes to self:
#1) Add data cleaning script first (need to correct for puzzle that was solved in the evening after moving on to the next puzzle)


#2) Need to format tables better... something to do with the kable function in knitr?
    #After much struggle (kable was producing a blank screen) I got the kable() function to work by:
    #1. installing the latest version of RStudio and 2. making sure I was using dplyr::summarize function
    #Also adding the kableExtra package gives additional simple formatting options

#3) There is apparently a way to cache things so that knitting doesn't take as long (reading in the data every time is a hassle)
    #seems like I just need to add the option "cache = TRUE" to a code chunk and it will cache instead of     #re-loading each time -- will need to be careful if it does change though and needs to be reloaded

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(plyr) #pre-emptively attaching plyr so it doesn't overwrite dplyr when loaded in the read script

```{r myfunctions, include = FALSE}

  #creates a row average at the end of the data frame and returns the updated data frame
  #assumes the first column is some sort of identifier/named column and therefore not meant to be averaged

  ncol <- ncol(df)
  df[nrow+1,1] <- "Average"

# Solving Analysis for Evening and Morning Data


```{r preprocessing, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
source("Overnight2018ReadPresentationData.R")
d <- Overnight2018ReadPresentationData()

EData <- d[[4]]
MData <- d[[5]]

EData <- EData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

MData <- MData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

```

## Solution Rates by Subject

### Evening

```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
e_propsolv <- EData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Solved = mean(Solved))

showNiceTable(e_propsolv, "Evening Solving Rates")

```

### Morning

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#Overall
m_propsolv <- MData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(Proportion_Solved = mean(Solved))

m_propsolv <- createAverageRow(m_propsolv) #add average row


showNiceTable(m_propsolv, "Morning Solving Rates") 

#By Cued Status
m_propsolv_CU <- MData %>%
  dplyr::group_by(SID,CuedStatus) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(ProportionSolved = mean(Solved)) %>%
  spread(CuedStatus, ProportionSolved) %>%
  mutate(CueingEffect = C - U)

m_propsolv_CU <- createAverageRow(m_propsolv_CU) #add average row


showNiceTable(m_propsolv_CU, "Morning Solving Rates by Cueing")
