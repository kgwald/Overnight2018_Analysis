```{r}
###Notes to self:
#1) Add data cleaning script first (need to correct for puzzle that was solved in the evening after moving on to the next puzzle)
#2) Need to format tables better... something to do with the kable function in knitr?
#3) There is apparently a way to cache things so that knitting doesn't take as long (reading in the data every time is a hassle)
#4) THIS IS AWESOME!!!

# Solving Analysis for Evening and Morning Data


```{r preprocessing, include=FALSE}
source("Overnight2018ReadPresentationData.R")
d <- Overnight2018ReadPresentationData()

EData <- d[[4]]
MData <- d[[5]]

EData <- EData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

MData <- MData %>%
  mutate(Solved = ifelse(TrialStatus == "solved",1,0))

```

## Solution Rates by Subject

### Evening

```{r echo = FALSE}
e_propsolv <- EData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(ProportionSolved = mean(Solved))

e_propsolv

```

### Morning

```{r, echo = FALSE}

m_propsolv <- MData %>%
  group_by(SID) %>%
  summarise(ProportionSolved = mean(Solved))

m_propsolv

m_propsolv_CU <- MData %>%
  group_by(SID,CuedStatus) %>%
  summarise(ProportionSolved = mean(Solved)) %>%
  spread(CuedStatus, ProportionSolved) %>%
  mutate(CueingEffect = C - U)

m_propsolv_CU

#show overall cueing effect
colMeans(m_propsolv_CU[,2:4])

```
